Tacky v1.0
===============

Take your nav and stick it up your page.

[Check out a demo here.](http://mcpants.github.com/jquery.tacky/)


Features
--------

* **No extra markup**
  Tacky automatically detects the links in your nav which keeps your code clean. Stay semantic or customize it to your exact needs.  

* **Powered by CSS**
  Tacky doesn't inject any inline CSS into your navigation, everything is controlled by the addition and removal of CSS classes. Use transitions to easily make your navigation stand out from the rest.

* **Responsive ready**
  Built in support for a toggle button lets you create custom mobile navigation by using media queries.

* **Free and open source**
  Tacky uses the MIT license and will forever be free to use, fork, and build upon.
